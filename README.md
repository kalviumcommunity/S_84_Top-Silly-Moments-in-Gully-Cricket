### **Project Title:**
Top Silly Moments in Gully Cricket

### **Project Overview:**
**"Top Silly Moments in Gully Cricket"** project is a fun and creative platform where users can log in, submit, and view the funniest or most absurd moments they've witnessed or experienced in gully (street) cricket. The project combines technical skills with a playful and engaging concept, showcasing my abilities in both front-end and back-end development.

### **FRONT-END**

1. **Component-Based Architecture:**  
   I will design components to display user profiles and individual moments. This will enhance my understanding of front-end development, specifically React's component-based structure.  
   
2. **UX Design:**  
   I will focus on creating an interactive UI where users can easily navigate through the moments, rate them, and add their own silly moments to the list. The design will prioritize ease of use, ensuring a seamless user experience.

3. **Routing & Navigation:**  
   Using JavaScript and React, I will create different views such as login, home page, and user-specific lists. This will help me improve my skills in routing and navigation within a React app.

### BACK-END

1. **API Design:**  
   I will build RESTful APIs to handle Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for the gully cricket moments. This will give me hands-on experience with API design, handling requests, and managing errors efficiently.

2. **Database Interaction (MongoDB & Mongoose):**  
   I will create Mongoose schemas to store user data, moments, and related information. This will enhance my understanding of how to design databases and interact with them using APIs.

### **Deployment:**

1. I will deploy both the frontend and backend on platforms like Render, Heroku, or netlify. This will help me gain practical experience with deployment and configuration for full-stack applications.

2. By using GitHub for version control, I will improve my collaborative development skills, including managing branches, handling pull requests, and merging code.

### **Data Security:**

1. I will implement secure password storage by hashing passwords and using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication, ensuring that user-sensitive data is securely stored and managed.

This project will help me gain practical experience with modern web development tools while providing an engaging platform for users to share and interact with the funniest moments from gully cricket. By completing this project, I will explain my skills in full-stack development, API design, database management, and user authentication.
